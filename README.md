# Meteor-Tutorial

## Testing out and learning the meteor framework

Its surprising how much this corsses over from the angular tutorial. I am using the built in meteor mongo db for now.


## How to use

Pull this repository (or download)
Then change into the directory and type:

> meteor

This will launch the compiler and send you a localhost address where the project is hosten on your machine.
